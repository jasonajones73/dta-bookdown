If approved, the Trustee shall make available a secure Data Trust Research Hub (“Research Hub”) for access by approved researchers, for approved research, and put in place a process for certifying academic researchers for access to Trust-managed Data Resources through the Research Hub. This Research Hub may be managed by the Trustee or  Trustee Affiliate(s). Approved uses, including approved academic research, shall be documented under Allowable Uses of Exhibit C attached hereto.

Individual researchers or research institutions ("Third Party Researcher") may submit a proposal for the use of Trust-managed Data Resources that include   personal information or sensitive personal information. This proposal must be approved in writing or by electronic approval process conducted by Trustee and Governance Board.

Prior to accessing any data via the Research Hub or any other means, Third Party Researchers will be required to execute a Data Trust researcher agreement with the Trustee on behalf of the Data Trust that stipulates the permissions, use, and analyses approved, including timeline and publications.  Further, Trustee or Trustee Affiliate(s) will provide prior written or electronic notice via Member's electronic portal that their data will be used by such Third Party Researcher as described in the Researcher data sharing agreement.
