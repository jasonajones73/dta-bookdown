An example of data security classification levels follows:

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

table_dat <- read_tsv("data/dta_security.tsv")

table_dat %>%
   kable(format = "html", align = c("l", "l")) %>%
   kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, position = "center") %>%
   row_spec(row = 0, align = "center") %>%
   column_spec(column = 1, width = "2.5in")

```
